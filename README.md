  ## Attribution
This project was built with my own contributions in coding and customization. I also used design inspiration and starter components from Figma, templates, and AI tools to speed up development. The base UI components were adapted to fit the project requirements.

This Figma Make file includes components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) used under [MIT license](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
